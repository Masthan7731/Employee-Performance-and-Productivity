Hello All,
I'm excited to share that i have done a data analysis on employee performance and productivity by using Power BI and Excel.

During this project i deep involvec in Time intelligence functions and ETL process to filter out the raw data in power BI.
In this project I investegated on 3 KPI's:
    1. YTD and MTM Number Of Employees, PYTD and PMTM Number of Employees, % increase on Employees compared to PYTD and PMTM.
    2. YTD and MTM Avg Performance Score, PYTD and PMTM Avg Performance Score, % increase on Avg Performance Score compared to PYTD and PMTM.
    3. YTD and MTM Total Salary, PYTD and PMTM Total Salary, % increase on Total Salary compared to PYTD and PMTM.

Charts:
  1. Total Salary by Education
  2. projects handled by department
  3. Total training hours by job title
  4. Weekly work hours by month
